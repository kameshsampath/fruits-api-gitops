## Overview

The Fruits API GitOps demostrates how to use [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) principles in
building and publishing your API using [Gloo Edge](https://www.solo.io/products/gloo-edge/). As part of this demo we
will build a simple Java REST API using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) and publish them them
using [Gloo Portal](https://www.solo.io/products/gloo-portal/).
